Hey, nice to see you :3

I'm a computer science student who's been programming for way too long. I'd love to give you a rundown as to what my interests are, but I'm interested in pretty much everything. If there's something that piques my interest, I will find the time to learn about it.

## My language knowledge

- Java, *8 years of hacky java development ruined me.*
- C, for all the low level stuff (also x86 asm).
- Rust, for all the quick and small projects.
- C++, still learning, but I'm adopting this for less painful low level code!
- HTML/CSS/JS, in case I'm forced to do frontend development *(i despise this work)*

I'm not going to list all the basic languages like bash or languages I've written once or twice like Python or C#.

## (Public) repository navigator

GitHub doesn't have any nice way to organize repositories, so this must do (my comments on each repo are mostly sarcastic):

- What you're probably here for:
  - [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk): Brings Lossless Scaling Frame Generation to Linux via Vulkan layer!
- OBS Plugins:
  - [obs-nvfbc-v30](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/obs-nvfbc-v30): Adds hacky NvFBC screencopy support to modern OBS versions (on life support)
  - [obs-wlroots-screencopy](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/obs-wlroots-screencopy): Objectively better wlroots screencopy that doesn't rely on a desktop portal or pipewire 
- Discord Bots:
  - [puppy-rs](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/puppy-rs): Anime reaction gifs without the need of adding the bot to a guild
  - [qotd](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/qotd): Quick and dirty bot I wrote for a friend who needed a "question of the day" bot
- Compositor-related projects:
  - [bdrm](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/bdrm): The kernel's DRM interface is absolutely horrendous, so here's b(etter)drm fixing it
  - [udevpp](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/udevpp): Udev is a glorified `ls` and `watch` c library, now available in c++!
  - ... work in progress?
- PiShock trilogy(+1): These were fun to develop, but as you can imagine I'm not maintaining these.
  - [PishockCeleste](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/PishockCeleste)
  - [pishock-mc](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/pishock-mc)
  - [pishock-cpma](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/pishock-cpma) (Challenge ProMode Arena)
  - [pishock-roulette](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/pishock-roulette) (for old singleplayer versions)
- Portal 2 mods:
  - [p2ghostrunner](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/p2ghostrunner): Unfinished (but still fun!) mod that brings Ghostrunner'ish movement to Portal 2

  - [otakugifs.c](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/otakugifs.c)/[nekos-best.c](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/nekos-best.c): Two header only c libraries for comfortably fetching images from two apis.
  - [nvidia-capture-java](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/nvidia-capture-java)/[nvidia-reflex-java](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/nvidia-reflex-java): Masochistic java bindings for two NVIDIA APIs.
  - [daybreak](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/daybreak): Minecraft server plugin implementing a pretty cool hardcore-like gamemode.
  - ... future projects!
